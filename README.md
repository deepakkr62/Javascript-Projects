# Javascript-Projects
A collection of JavaScript projects created for hands-on learning and skill-building. Each folder contains a standalone project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Great for practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, logic building, and more.

This repository serves as my coding playground while learning JavaScriptâ€”feel free to explore the mini projects and share your feedback!
